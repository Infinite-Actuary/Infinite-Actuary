### Hi there 👋

After two years of attending UNL 📚 this is what I have learned:

If you're an undergraduate interested in Actuarial Science, UNL is a great place to go 💯. Sadly, if you're a masters student, UNL may not be a good fit for you 😞.

First, there is no getting around classes 👨‍🏫 with these two professors:

* [Colin Ramsay](https://business.unl.edu/people/cramsay/) with `2.7/5.0` [rating](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2115056) - **LTAM**
* [Mostafa Mashayekhi](https://directory.unl.edu/people/mmashayekhi1) with `1.3/5.0` [rating](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1911210) - **IFM**

At the very least, I recommend you contact ☎️ both professors and introduce yourself. That should give you a better idea of how you will get along 🤝🏼.

Second, you'll find that career fairs 👔, internships and other company partnerships are geared toward the undergraduate experience. While there are lots of good connections and job opportunities, job placement 💼 is streamlined for undergraduates.

🗺️ Good luck on your journey!
